# Open diff from vim

usually we can just do `vimdiff file1 file2`
Though it requires input of file1 and file2.

We can simply open either file1 or file2 first.
Then use `:diffs .`
Then navigate with netrw to open the another file
Then `:difft` on that new window.

Then use `do` (diffput) to select the diff you want to use!
